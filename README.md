# MEMORY ARC

**MEMORY ARC** is an interactive **pattern-matching game** built in **C++** using the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. Designed for both fun and mental stimulation, the game progressively increases in complexity and speed, challenging the player's memory and attention span across three levels.

---

## Game Overview

In MEMORY ARC, the player is presented with a grid of boxes. In each round, a specific pattern of boxes is briefly highlighted. The player must then accurately **replicate the pattern by clicking** the correct boxes in the correct order.

As rounds progress:
- The **speed increases**
- The **length of the pattern grows**
- The **difficulty ramps up**

### Levels

| Level        | Grid Size | Pattern Speed | Complexity |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Beginner     | 4 Boxes   | Slow           | Easy       |
| Intermediate | 6 Boxes   | Medium         | Moderate   |
| Expert       | 8 Boxes   | Fast           | Challenging|

### Step-by-Step SFML Setup (Windows + Visual Studio)

1. **Download and extract SFML:**
   - [Download SFML for Visual C++](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
   - Extract to: `C:\SFML`

2. **Create/Open your Visual Studio project**

3. **Configure project properties:**

   - **Include directories:**
     ```
     C:\SFML\include
     ```

   - **Library directories:**
     ```
     C:\SFML\lib
     ```

   - **Linker â†’ Input â†’ Additional Dependencies (Debug mode):**
     ```
     sfml-graphics-d.lib
     sfml-window-d.lib
     sfml-system-d.lib
     ```

     *(For Release mode, remove `-d` from each)*

4. **Add DLLs to your projectâ€™s output folder (Debug/Release):**

   Copy from `C:\SFML\bin`:
   sfml-graphics-d-2.dll
   sfml-window-d-2.dll
